# Hokkaido - Switch 2 Emulator for Android

Hokkaido is a Nintendo Switch 2 emulator for Android, maintained by [pavelgajdo](https://github.com/pavelgajdo). It continues the work of yuzu, Sudachi, Eden, [Eglantine](https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine) and [Lichii](https://github.com/zortos293/Lichii), and focuses on getting Switch 2 games running on Android phones, starting with Samsung's Exynos phones and their AMD-based Xclipse GPUs.

Hokkaido was called Lichii for Android until version 0.5.0. Installed copies update in place and keep their games, saves and settings.

This is an independent, experimental project. It is not affiliated with Nintendo or with the projects it builds on.

## Download

- **Releases:** [github.com/pavelgajdo/Hokkaido/releases](https://github.com/pavelgajdo/Hokkaido/releases). Download the `.apk` from the latest `android-*` release and install it on your phone. You may need to allow installs from your browser or file manager.
- **Test builds:** the `android-latest` pre-release is rebuilt automatically from every change on `nx2`. It has the newest fixes and the newest bugs.

Requirements: an arm64 phone with Android 13 or newer and Vulkan 1.3. Games, keys and firmware are not included. Only use games and system files you have legally obtained.

## Tested on

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| Phone | Samsung Galaxy S26 (SM-S942B) | Samsung Galaxy S24 / S24+ (SM-S921B / SM-S926B) |
| SoC | Exynos 2600 | Exynos 2400 |
| GPU | Samsung Xclipse 960 (AMD RDNA3, GFX11) | Samsung Xclipse 940 (AMD RDNA3, GFX11) |
| RAM | 12 GB | 8 GB / 12 GB |
| OS | Android 17 (One UI) | Android 17 (One UI) |
| GPU driver | Custom Mesa RADV build for Xclipse ("RADV Xclipse", Mesa 27.0-devel), installed through the app's GPU driver manager | Same |

Samsung's own driver on the S26 is also RADV-based and works, but it is slower on this phone than the custom RADV build.

Other phones may work, but these are the only devices Hokkaido is tested on so far.

## Game status

| Game | Status |
|---|---|
| The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Switch 2) | Playable on 12 GB phones (Galaxy S24+). Defaults to 0.5x resolution on Android; enable the built-in `FPS Unlock` patch for 60 FPS. |
| Pokémon Pokopia | Playable and smooth, also on 8 GB phones. The sky is black. |
| Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave | Playable. Use 0.5x resolution and leave "Present a frame ahead" on Auto. |

Only results tested on the phones above are listed here.

### What's different from upstream

- AV1 movies are decoded with Android's hardware decoder (MediaCodec).
- Ocarina of Time's movies skip the game's movie-enhancement neural network (which needs NVIDIA tensor cores), and show the movie frame directly.
- Ocarina of Time defaults to 0.5x resolution on Android and supports bypassing the anti-aliasing neural network (`No sharpening`) on both 1.0.0 and updated builds.
- Full Xclipse GPU detection (`RADV MAGELLAN`, `RADV VANGOGHLITE`, Samsung vendor ID), RADV GFX11 mesh shader SGPR fix, and task/mesh shader prologue initialization & compute fallback on both Xclipse (RADV) and Adreno (Turnip) so gameplay does not freeze on Galaxy S24 / S24+.
- Emulated tensor-core math (HMMA) is faster on RADV.
- Memory limits tuned for 8–12 GB phones: resilient VMA buffer allocation, automatic eviction of unused transient render targets, smaller mesh emulation arenas, and complete GPU/SMMU memory unmapping on destroy.
- Fast 16-byte block-linear texture swizzle/unswizzle and lock-free GPU `TickWork` fast path.
- `EDEN_*` diagnostic switches can be set on Android with an `env.txt` file (see below).

## Recommended settings

- **System:** Handheld mode.
- **CPU:** NCE backend.
- **Graphics:** 0.5x resolution. Install a custom RADV driver if your phone has an Xclipse GPU.
- Close other apps before starting a game: Android closes games when memory runs low.

## Reporting problems

[Open an issue](https://github.com/pavelgajdo/Hokkaido/issues) with:

- your phone model, Android version and GPU driver;
- the game and what happened (screenshots help);
- the log from the affected session: `Android/data/dev.lichii.android/files/log/eden_log.txt` (`dev.lichii.android.relWithDebInfo` for test builds).

Check logs for personal information before uploading. Never upload games, keys, firmware or account data.

### Diagnostic switches

Android can't pass environment variables to an app, so Hokkaido reads them from `Android/data/<app id>/files/env.txt`, one `KEY=VALUE` per line (`#` starts a comment). They take effect the next time the app starts. The available switches are listed in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#debugging-tools). Leave the file empty for normal play: most switches slow the emulator down.

## Building

```bash
cd src/android
./gradlew assembleMainlineRelWithDebInfo
```

You need the Android SDK, NDK 28.2 and CMake 3.22. The APK is written to `src/android/app/build/outputs/apk/mainline/relWithDebInfo/`. CI builds every push (see [.github/workflows/android.yml](.github/workflows/android.yml)). Pushing a tag named `android-<version>` publishes a release with the APK.
